# A Shooter Game with Flame

This is my attempt in recreating the elements of Bad Shmup, a game I made with Unity, using Flutter Flame as the primary game engine.

### Notes

- The future of this repository is still undecided, but I will work on this when I get the time.
- Bad Shmup, the game I initally created, can be downloaded [here](https://thealoofpotato.itch.io/bad-shmup).
